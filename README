nopac is a simple way to install and maintain a compiled package binaries
to keep them separately from the system but create only links to the real files.
This approach was inspired by GoboLinux.

What it does ?
==============
- allows to easy track which files of which package are installed in the system
  without using any special package db but simply create a link in / and point to the
  real file

- allows to have alternative compiled package's version and easy switch between
  them by changing package's 'current' link to the alternative one. It should be
  used only for same package's version but a bit modified to match same files
  installed by the 'current' one

What it does not ?
==================
- does not track the package's dependencies
- does not use any external repo to download the package and its dependencies
